# Box File Renamer

## Disclaimer

This is a first crack at a file renamer script for a specific purpose. I don't have a strong programming background and, doubtlessly, someone has done this before and has done a much better job than I have. This is, however, a learning experience. :-)

## Description and Purpose

This script is designed to replace unsafe characters in the names of files and folders before migrating them to [Box](https://www.box.com). The unsafe characters in the script are a combination of those noted in [Box's Sync FAQ](https://support.box.com/entries/20366301-box-sync-faq) as well as characters that are best avoided in filenames in Mac OS X.
