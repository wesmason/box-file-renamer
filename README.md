# Box File Renamer

## Disclaimer

This is a first crack at a file renamer script for a specific purpose. I'm sure that something has been done before and there are surely many better ways of doing this, but it has been a learning experience for me. :-)

## Purpose

This script is designed to replace unsafe characters in filenames and folder names with safe characters before uploading them to Box (https://www.box.com) as per the information on Box's FAQ (https://support.box.com/entries/20366301-box-sync-faq).
